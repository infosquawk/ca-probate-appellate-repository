DEPLOY_COMPLETE_WEBSITE.bat
```
**This will automatically:**
- Upload the fixed website with working file links
- Upload all PDFs (8 documents)
- Upload all text files (22 files)  
- Upload cover images (3 files)
- Create proper directory structure
- Verify successful deployment

### Option 2: Test FTP First
```bash
# Test your connection first:
TEST_FTP_CONNECTION.bat

# Then deploy if test passes:
DEPLOY_COMPLETE_WEBSITE.bat
```

## 📁 Files Created

### 🤖 **Deployment Scripts**
- `deploy_complete_website.py` - Main deployment engine (311 lines)
- `DEPLOY_COMPLETE_WEBSITE.bat` - Windows batch runner
- `test_ftp_connection.py` - FTP connection tester  
- `TEST_FTP_CONNECTION.bat` - Test runner

### 🌐 **Website File**

## 🔧 How It Works

### **Smart File Upload System**
```python
# The script automatically:
1. Connects to probrep.com via FTP
2. Creates directory structure:
   /public_html/
   ├── index.html (from index_WORKING_LINKS.html)
   ├── covers/ (3 PNG files)
   ├── pdfs/published/ (3 PDF files)
   ├── pdfs/unpublished/ (5 PDF files)
   └── texts/ (22 TXT files)
3. Uploads all files with progress tracking
4. Verifies successful deployment
```

### **Built-in Safety Features**

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **"FTP Connection Failed"**
```bash
# Check these:
1. Verify internet connection
2. Run TEST_FTP_CONNECTION.bat first
3. Check firewall settings
4. Verify FTP credentials in godaddy_config.ini
```

#### **"Permission Denied"**
```bash
# Solutions:
1. Verify sysop2@probrep.com has write access
2. Check /public_html directory permissions
3. Contact GoDaddy support if needed
```

#### **"File Not Found"**
```bash
# Solutions:
1. Ensure index_WORKING_LINKS.html exists
2. Check that pdfs/ and texts/ directories exist
3. Run from correct directory (website folder)
```

#### **"Some Files Failed to Upload"**
```bash
# This is usually okay:
1. Script continues with other files
2. Check which specific files failed
3. Re-run script to retry failed uploads
4. Large files may timeout - check hosting limits
```

### **Script Output Meanings**

#### **Success Indicators**
```
✅ [X/33] PDF (published): pdfs/published/filename.pdf (123.4 KB)
✅ Verified: index.html
🎉 DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL!

## 🔄 Re-deployment

### **To Update Website Only**
```python
# Edit the deployment script to skip files:
# Comment out these lines in deploy_complete_website.py:
# ("Cover Images", self.deploy_covers),
# ("PDF Documents", self.deploy_pdfs), 
# ("Text Files", self.deploy_texts)
```

### **To Add New Files**
1. Add new PDFs to `pdfs/published/` or `pdfs/unpublished/`
2. Add new text files to `texts/`
3. Run `DEPLOY_COMPLETE_WEBSITE.bat` again
4. Script will upload new files and skip existing ones

## 🔐 Security Notes

### **FTP Credentials**
- Stored in `godaddy_config.ini` (local file only)
- Not uploaded to server
- Change passwords periodically for security

### **Backup Strategy**  
- Script creates backup: `index.backup_[timestamp].html`
- Local files remain unchanged
- Previous versions preserved on server
