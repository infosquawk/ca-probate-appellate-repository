# ProBrep.com Website Update - File Links Fixed
**Date:** July 23, 2025
**Status:** READY FOR DEPLOYMENT - File linking issues resolved

## Issue Fixed

The database-integrated website was showing episode information but missing links to related files (PDFs, text documents, case briefs). The fixed version now intelligently constructs and displays all file links.

## What's New in the Fixed Version

### Enhanced File Link System
- **Smart URL Construction**: Automatically generates file URLs based on case numbers and file naming conventions
- **Multiple File Types**: Shows links for PDFs, text files, case briefs, and audio (when available)
- **Visual Improvements**: Color-coded buttons with icons for different file types:
  - 🎧 **Listen** (Green) - Audio files from Podbean
  - 📄 **Case Brief** (Purple) - AI-generated case analysis
  - 📝 **Read Text** (Blue) - Extracted text documents  
  - 📑 **View PDF** (Orange) - Original court documents

### File Location Intelligence
The website now automatically constructs file paths based on:
- Case numbers (e.g., B333052, G063155)
- Publication status (published vs unpublished)
- File naming conventions from Scholar Podcast system
- Expected directory structure (`pdfs/published/`, `pdfs/unpublished/`, `texts/`)

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Upload Fixed Website File
1. **Upload** `index_database_integrated_FIXED.html` to your probrep.com hosting
2. **Rename** it to `index.html` (replacing the current file)
3. **Verify** the database API is still accessible at `/api/episodes.php`

### Step 2: Ensure File Structure Exists
The website expects these directories to contain the actual files:
```
probrep.com/
├── index.html (the fixed version)
├── api/episodes.php (existing database API)
├── covers/ (cover images)
├── pdfs/
│   ├── published/ (published court documents)
│   └── unpublished/ (unpublished court documents)
└── texts/ (text extracts and case briefs)
```

### Step 3: File Synchronization (Optional)
If you want the file links to actually work, you'll need to upload the files from your Scholar Podcast system:

**From Scholar Podcast System:**
```
probate_cases/pdfs/published/ → probrep.com/pdfs/published/
probate_cases/pdfs/unpublished/ → probrep.com/pdfs/unpublished/
probate_cases/pdfs/published_text/ → probrep.com/texts/
podcast/case_briefs/ → probrep.com/texts/ (as brief_*.txt)
```

## Expected Results After Deployment

### Before (Current Issue):
- ❌ Episodes show but no file links appear
- ❌ Empty action buttons section
- ❌ No way to access related documents

### After (Fixed Version):
- ✅ Each episode shows 2-4 colored action buttons
- ✅ Case Brief button for AI-generated analysis
- ✅ Read Text button for extracted documents
- ✅ View PDF button for original court documents
- ✅ Listen button (when Podbean URLs are available)

### Sample Episode Display:
```
[B333052] [brief]
Conservatorship of ANNE S
California Appellate Court

[Professional AI description...]

Duration: 6:42
[📄 Case Brief] [📝 Read Text] [📑 View PDF]
```

## File Link Examples
The fixed website will generate these types of links:

**For Case B333052 (Published):**
- PDF: `pdfs/published/B333052_Conservatorship_of_ANNE_S_published.pdf`
- Text: `texts/B333052_Conservatorship_of_ANNE_S_published.txt`
- Brief: `texts/brief_B333052_case_brief.txt`

**For Case B330596 (Unpublished):**
- PDF: `pdfs/unpublished/B330596_Nelson_v_Huhn_unpublished.pdf`
- Text: `texts/B330596_Nelson_v_Huhn_unpublished.txt`
- Brief: `texts/brief_B330596_case_brief.txt`

## Technical Improvements

5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Displays properly on mobile devices
