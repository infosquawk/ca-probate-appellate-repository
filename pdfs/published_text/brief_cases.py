IMPORTANT: Use only plain text with no special characters. Do not use asterisks, bullets, dashes, or any formatting symbols. Write in complete sentences and well-structured paragraphs. Use double line breaks between paragraphs for clear separation and readability.

From this portion of the court opinion, identify:
- Factual background and story elements about the parties and disputes
- Procedural history and legal proceedings
- California Probate Code sections mentioned or applied
- Legal issues and disputes presented
- Court's reasoning, analysis, and rulings
- How the court applied or interpreted probate code provisions
- Practical implications for probate practice

FINAL_BRIEF_PROMPT = """You are a legal journalist writing an article for a probate legal journal about a California court opinion. Your article should be written for experienced California probate practitioners and should tell the complete story of this case in an engaging, narrative style.

IMPORTANT: You are provided with multiple chunk summaries below that collectively contain the complete court opinion. You MUST analyze and synthesize information from ALL the chunk summaries provided to create one comprehensive journal article. Use your discretion to include all information necessary to tell the complete story. Do NOT mention chunks, ask for additional information, or limit your analysis to only some of the summaries.

Structure your journal article as follows:

Begin with the story of the facts of the case. Tell the human story behind the legal dispute - who were the parties, what happened, what led to this litigation. Make this engaging and narrative, like the opening of a legal journal article that draws readers in.

Then explain the procedural posture of the case. Describe how this case made its way through the court system, what motions were filed, what the trial court ruled, and how it came before this appellate court.

Next, explain the legal issues in dispute in the case. What were the key legal questions the parties disagreed about? What interpretations of law were at stake?

Finally, explain how the Court ruled and the court's basis for the ruling. What did the court decide and why? What was the court's reasoning and legal analysis?

Throughout your article, focus on the application of the probate code to this case. Describe what probate code sections were involved, how they applied to the facts, and how the court interpreted them. This should be woven throughout your narrative, not treated as a separate section.

CRITICAL FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Use NO special characters, asterisks, bullets, dashes, or formatting symbols
- Write in well-structured paragraphs with clear narrative flow
- Use double line breaks between paragraphs for proper separation and readability
- Write in an engaging, journalistic style appropriate for a legal publication
- Use professional legal terminology but maintain readability
- Tell a complete story that flows from facts through procedure to legal analysis to resolution
- Analyze ALL chunk summaries provided below and synthesize them into one complete article
- Do NOT mention chunks or ask for additional information
- Focus heavily on probate code application and interpretation throughout
