This article delves into the intricate details of this California Court opinion, exploring the factual background, procedural history, legal issues, and court's reasoning that shaped its ruling. Layla Boyajian was married to Mike Boyajian for 50 years, raising four children together, including Robert and Anush. As their marriage came to an end in 2004, tensions rose between Layla and Robert, ultimately leading to the execution of a holographic will in 2006, leaving all of her estate to Anush. Years later, when Layla was 71 years old, she signed a document before a notary public that purportedly revoked all prior estate planning documents. The stage was set for a probate dispute that would test the boundaries of California's Probate Code. After Layla's passing in 2020, Anush petitioned to probate the 2006 will, only to be met with opposition from Robert, who claimed that Layla had revoked the will by cancellation through the 2018 document. The trial court conducted a bench trial, featuring dozens of exhibits and expert testimony. The legal issues at stake were twofold: whether the 2018 document effectively revoked the 2006 will through cancellation and whether Anush unduly influenced Layla in signing the original will. The California Probate Code sections relevant to this dispute included Section 6120, subdivision (a) and (b), governing revocation by a subsequent will or cancellation. In its ruling, the court emphasized that revocation by cancellation requires a physical alteration of the will, citing section 6120's requirement for ""some act done to the document."" The court rejected Robert's argument that the 2018 document could be considered a ""subsequent will"" under Section 45, as it did not meet the definition of an instrument and failed to transfer or dispose of any property upon death. The court also addressed the issue of undue influence, finding that Layla was not unduly influenced when signing the original will or the 2018 document. This decision has significant implications for probate practitioners, highlighting the importance of meeting formalities and understanding the requirements for revoking a will through cancellation. In conclusion, the case of Layla Boyajian presents a complex web of legal issues, procedural history, and factual background that is essential for probate practitioners to navigate. As the court's ruling emphasizes, compliance with formalities and careful consideration when drafting revocations and testamentary instruments are crucial in ensuring the validity of a will. This decision serves as a valuable reminder for practitioners to advise clients about the limitations of stand-alone revocations and the importance of meeting formalities to ensure the effectiveness of their wishes. The practical implications for probate practice are far-reaching, emphasizing the need for careful consideration when drafting testamentary instruments and advising clients on revocation strategies. This case serves as a valuable tool for practitioners seeking guidance on navigating these complex issues, ultimately providing a more comprehensive understanding of California's Probate Code."
