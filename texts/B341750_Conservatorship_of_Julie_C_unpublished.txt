Amy Brophy as Successor Trustee of the Christopher 
Prettyman Special Needs Trust and Christopher Prettyman 
(collectively, Appellants) appeal a probate court order overruling 
their objections to a conservator's accounting of Prettyman's 
mother's estate. Finding no error, we affirm. 
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 
 
Julie C.1 has been under a court-ordered conservatorship 
since Respondent Los Angeles County Office of the Public 
Guardian (Public Guardian) was appointed as temporary 
conservator of Julie's person and estate on October 6, 2021. The 
conservatorship proceeding is Los Angeles Superior Court case 
No. 21STPB04248, and that is the case before us in this appeal 
(the Conservatorship Case). The Public Guardian became the 
permanent conservator of Julie's person and estate in February 
2022. Letters of conservatorship issued.  
The Christopher Prettyman Special Needs Trust 
(Prettyman Trust) was established in 2016 for the care of 
Prettyman, a dependent adult and Julie's son. Julie was initially 
the trustee of the Prettyman Trust, but after she was conserved, 
she was replaced by Amy Brophy in April 2022.  
During the pendency of the Conservatorship Case, on 
August 2, 2023, Brophy filed a "Petition for Statutory and 
Related Relief Against the County of Los Angeles for Aggravated 
and Intentional Elder Abuse of Disabled Dependent Adult" in 
superior court case No. 23STPB08451 (the Related Case).2 
 
1  
Because Julie is a conservatee, we refer to her by her first 
name and last initial. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.90(b)(2).)  
2  
Appellants included a number of documents from the 
Related Case in the appendix they filed as part of the record on 
 

 
 
3 
Although the court ordered the Conservatorship Case and the 
Related Case related on August 16, 2023, they remain separate, 
and we summarize their procedural histories in turn.  
I. 
The Conservatorship Case (No. 21STPB04248) 
On October 5, 2022, Brophy filed a Petition to Compel 
Return of Trust Property in the Conservatorship Case. (See Prob. 
Code, §§ 850, subd. (a)(1), (3),3 859; Welf. & Inst. Code, 
§ 15657.5.) Among other things, Brophy claimed: approximately 
$77,000 had been transferred from the Prettyman Trust to Julie's 
bank account in March 2021; the Public Guardian was wrongfully 
holding those funds; and the Prettyman Trust should be given a 
lien against Julie's estate. The Public Guardian opposed the 
petition in part because Brophy "has not proven that any funds 
spent by [Julie] before the court ordered the temporary 
conservatorship on October 6, 2021[,] was [sic] not used on 
 
appeal. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rules 8.120(a)(1)(B), 8.124.) But 
those documents are not part of the record in this appeal, and 
that is not the proper means to obtain judicial notice of them. 
(See Evid. Code, §§ 452, subd. (d)(1), 459; Cal. Rules of Court, 
rule 8.252(a)(1).)  
Nevertheless, both parties' briefs discuss the proceedings in 
the Related Case and the Public Guardian has not objected to our 
considering the documents. We thus construe Appellants' 
appendix as a request for judicial notice and, so construed, grant 
it. (Cf. Grosz v. California Dept. of Tax & Fee Administration 
(2023) 87 Cal.App.5th 428, 448 [courts taking judicial notice " 'do 
not take notice of the truth of matters stated therein' "].) 
 
3  
All further undesignated references are to the Probate 
Code.

[Prettyman]," and because Prettyman used Julie's bank card to 
make purchases for himself. 
While that petition was pending, the Public Guardian filed 
a First Account Current and Report on April 21, 2023, covering 
the period September 28, 2021, through February 2, 2023. 
(See Prob. Code, §§ 1060–1064, 2620, 2640.) Brophy objected to 
the First Account Current on August 4, 2023, largely on the 
ground it failed to identify funds in Julie's estate ostensibly taken 
from the Prettyman Trust. (See § 2622.) The Public Guardian 
responded that because the court had yet to rule on Brophy's 
October 5, 2022, Petition, it was speculative and premature to 
include any funds purportedly owed to the Prettyman Trust in 
the First Account Current.  
On January 26, 2024, the trial court overruled Brophy's 
objections to the First Account Current, granted the April 21, 
2023, Accounting, and ordered the Public Guardian to file an 
accounting for the period February 3, 2023, through January 31, 
2024, by May 31, 2024. The written order memorializing that 
decision was issued a few weeks later, on February 9, 2024, and 
specifically provided: "Nothing in this order should be construed 
as a determination that any property alleged to be property of the 
. . . Prettyman . . . Trust in the 10/5/2022 850 petition is in fact 
property of this conservatorship estate." There was no appeal.  
Also on January 26, 2024, the trial court ordered Brophy to 
show cause why her October 5, 2022, Petition "should not be 
denied without prejudice given the relief requested is duplicative 
of the . . . petition [filed in the Related Case] and does not meet 
the appropriate relief for a conservatorship matter." After 
receiving briefing, the court denied the October 5, 2022, Petition 
without prejudice on April 16, 2024. There was no appeal.  

 
 
5 
The Public Guardian filed its Second Account Current and 
Report on May 24, 2024, for the period February 3, 2023, through 
May 7, 2024. Appellants objected, arguing the account was 
incomplete because it failed to identify funds in Julie's estate that 
the petition in the Related Case claimed belonged to the 
Prettyman Trust. The trial court overruled the objections and 
approved the Second Account Current and Report on August 16, 
2024. Appellants timely appealed that order. (See Cal. Rules of 
Court, rule 8.104(a), (c)(2), (e).) 
II. 
The Related Case (No. 23STPB08451) 
Brophy initiated the Related Case on August 2, 2023, with 
a section 850 petition. Brophy stated her claims there were "in 
addition to and supplement [her] pending claims in" the 
Conservatorship Case–specifically, she asked the Public 
Guardian to recognize a portion of Julie's funds rightfully 
belonged to the Prettyman Trust and should be returned to it. 
However, the prayer for relief was largely identical to the prayer 
contained in the October 5, 2022, Petition, save for her requests 
the court find the Public Guardian "committed elder abuse upon 
a disabled dependent adult," reconsider its prior rulings, and 
provide an additional recovery for Prettyman. A few weeks later, 
Brophy filed a notice of related cases, and the court determined 
case Nos. 21STPB04248 and 23STPB08451 were related. 
On January 26, 2024, the court issued an order to show 
cause in the Related Case "[w]hy this petition should not be 
denied without prejudice and refiled in the civil department as 
a[n] elder abuse case." After receiving briefing, the court allowed 
Brophy to file an amended petition in the Related Case, and later 
denied the initial petition without prejudice. Brophy duly filed a 
First Amended Petition on May 9, 2024.  

 
 
6 
After the order before us on appeal was issued in the 
Conservatorship Case, the court in the Related Case struck the 
First Amended Petition with leave to amend because it failed to 
comply with California Rules of Court, rule 2.112.4 The parties 
inform us the Related Case remains pending.  
DISCUSSION 
I. 
Our Review Is Limited to the Order on Appeal 
" 'Our jurisdiction on appeal is limited in scope to the notice 
of appeal and the . . . order appealed from.' " (Faunce v. Cate 
(2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 166, 170 (Faunce).) This notice of appeal 
was filed on October 15, 2024, and expressly appealed from the 
order entered in the Conservatorship Case on August 16, 2024, 
approving the Second Account Current. (See Cal. Rules of Court, 
rule 8.100(a)(1)–(2).) The Probate Code renders that order 
appealable. (See Hudson v. Foster (2021) 68 Cal.App.5th 640, 660 
["[a]n order settling an account of a fiduciary" is appealable]; 
Prob. Code, §§ 2620, subd. (a), 1300, subd. (b); see also Code Civ. 
Proc., § 904.1, subd. (a)(10).)5 Thus, the order before us in this 
 
4  
California Rules of Court, rule 2.112 requires each cause of 
action specifically state its number, nature, and the party 
asserting it against which other party or parties. (Rule 2.112(1)–
(4).) 
5  
We reject Appellants' assertion the order approving the 
Second Account Current is an order "[a]djudicating the merits of 
a claim made under Part 19 (commencing with Section 850) of 
Division 2." (§ 1300, subd. (k).) The order did no such thing. 
Brophy's section 850 claim(s) had already been dismissed from 
the Conservatorship Case four months earlier. And her 
section 850 petition in the Related Case remained pending.  

 
 
7 
appeal is the August 16, 2024, order approving the Second 
Account Current. 
Appellants acknowledge "the First Account Current . . . is 
not the subject of this [a]ppeal," but portions of their briefing 
appear to take issue with both the January 26, 2024, order 
approving the First Account Current and the April 16, 2024, 
denial of Brophy's petition in the Conservatorship Case. To the 
extent Appellants argue their October 15, 2024, notice of appeal 
has brought those earlier orders before us, we do not agree. "We 
have no jurisdiction over an order not mentioned in the notice of 
appeal" and "no jurisdiction to act on an untimely appeal." 
(Faunce, supra, 222 Cal.App.4th at p. 170.) Not only was 
October 15, 2024, too late to appeal those orders (see Cal. Rules of 
Court, rule 8.104(a), (c)(2), (e)), but the notice expressly stated it 
appealed from the August 16, 2024, order.  
Much of the rest of Appellants' briefing appears to 
challenge the trial court's decisions in the Related Case, as shown 
by the opening brief's repeated citations to the First Amended 
Petition and other documents filed in that case (even including 
events postdating the notice of appeal). But no notice of appeal in 
the Related Case was filed or is before us here, and therefore we 
have no jurisdiction to entertain Appellants' arguments 
concerning the trial court's actions in that proceeding. (See 
Silverbrand v. County of Los Angeles (2009) 46 Cal.4th 106, 113 
[without a timely notice of appeal, " 'an appellate court is without 
jurisdiction to determine the merits of the appeal' "].) Rather, the 
trial court retains jurisdiction in that matter. (Cf. Varian Medical 
Systems, Inc. v. Delfino (2005) 35 Cal.4th 180, 196–197 [" 'the 
trial court is divested of' subject matter jurisdiction . . . during 
the pendency of [the] appeal"].) Because the Related Case is not 

 
 
8 
before us, we decline Appellants' invitation to opine on that 
proceeding.  
II. 
The Trial Court Did Not Err in Approving the 
Second Account Current 
Appellants concede they "are not appealing what the 
accounting said" in the Second Account Current. Rather, they 
contend some property in the conservatorship estate actually 
belongs to the Prettyman Trust and should have been identified 
as a " 'liability' " in the Account. We disagree.  
A. 
Legal Framework 
We review the trial court's interpretation of the Probate 
Code de novo. (Kucker v. Kucker (2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 90, 93.)  
The Probate Code requires a conservator to periodically 
"present the accounting of the assets of the estate of the . . . 
conservatee to the court for settlement and allowance in the 
manner provided in Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 1060) of 
Part 1 of Division 3." (§ 2620, subd. (a).) That chapter provides 
"[a]ll accounts shall state the period covered by the account and 
contain a summary showing" applicable categories defined by 
statute, including assets, gains, disbursements, losses, and 
distributions during the period. (§ 1061, subds. (a)–(b).) "The 
summary shall be supported by detailed schedules" providing 
more information about those categories. (§ 1062, subds. (a)–(f).)  
Certain additional schedules may also be required. 
(§ 1063.) For example, "[i]f, at the end of the accounting period, 
there are liabilities of the estate," a schedule must show: "(1) All 
liabilities which are a lien on estate or trust assets. [¶] (2) Taxes 
due but unpaid as shown on filed returns or assessments received 
subsequent to filing of returns. [¶] (3) All notes payable. [¶] 
(4) Any judgments for which the estate or trust is liable. [¶] 

 
 
9 
(5) Any other material liability." (§ 1063, subd. (g).) However, "no 
information in addition to that required in this chapter need be in 
an account." (§ 1060.) 
Some individuals are permitted to file objections to the 
conservator's account. (§ 2622.) Those "written objections" must 
"stat[e] the items of the account to which objection is made and 
the basis for the objection." (Ibid.) 
B. 
Appellants' Objections Were Properly Overruled 
Appellants' objections were properly overruled because 
Appellants failed to offer any documentary or other substantive 
proof to support their assertion the account omitted a "liabilit[y] 
of the estate." (§ 1063, subd. (g).) The question whether certain 
property in Julie's estate in fact belongs to the Prettyman Trust, 
and the amount of any fees or penalties arising from the 
supposed withholding of those funds, is being litigated in the 
Related Case and is not before us in this appeal. Appellants have 
cited no authority supporting their notion that an objector's claim 
for a potential, future recovery amounts to a "liabilit[y]" that 
must be reported pursuant to section 1063, subdivision (g).6 On 
this record, the trial court appropriately overruled Appellants' 
objections and approved the Second Account Current.7 
 
6  
On the contrary, "an order settling an accounting in a 
conservatorship proceeding has res judicata effect." (Knox v. Dean 
(2012) 205 Cal.App.4th 417, 424; see also § 2103, subd. (a).) That 
supports the Public Guardian's position it would be inappropriate 
to prematurely include a speculative claim. 
7  
We reject Appellants' inapposite reliance upon cases in 
which beneficiaries filed complaints against trustees for alleged 
misconduct. (See Estate of McCabe (1950) 98 Cal.App.2d 503, 504, 
508; Purdy v. Johnson (1917) 174 Cal. 521, 523–525; cf. Clark v. 
 

 
 
10 
C. 
We Reject Appellants' Remaining Contentions 
While Appellants' remaining contentions are difficult to 
discern, they appear to argue the trial court should not have 
relied upon the affidavits the Public Guardian submitted with the 
Second Account Current and should have held an evidentiary 
hearing on their objections. (See § 1022.) " '[W]hen challenged in 
a lower court, affidavits and verified petitions may not be 
considered as evidence at a contested probate hearing.' " (Estate 
of Bennett (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1303, 1309 (Bennett).) 
However, " 'where the parties do not object to the use of affidavits 
in evidence, [they] cannot question the propriety of the procedure 
on appeal.' " (Evangelho v. Presoto (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 615, 620 
(Evangelho).)  
Appellants have not shown they objected to the trial court's 
reliance upon affidavits in evaluating the Second Account 
Current, let alone requested an evidentiary hearing. (Cf. Bennett, 
supra, 163 Cal.App.4th at p. 1309 [issue was preserved for review 
where party "asserted in written opposition and at the hearing 
that factual conflicts presented by the parties' competing 
declarations mandated an evidentiary hearing"].) While 
Appellants objected to the Public Guardian's account because it 
was incomplete and did not include the amount ostensibly owed 
to the Prettyman Trust, those were "not objections to the type of 
 
State Bar (1952) 39 Cal.2d 161, 164–165, 172–173 [attorney's 
appeal from bar suspension due to negligent performance as 
guardian of an estate], superseded by rule on other grounds as 
stated in Black v. State Bar (1962) 57 Cal.2d 219, 227.) This 
appeal does not involve a complaint by a beneficiary against a 
trustee; it arises from an order approving a conservator's interim 
accounting of a conservatee's estate.  

 
 
11 
evidence before the trial court." (Evangelho, supra, 
67 Cal.App.4th at p. 621.) " 'Absent an objection, the[] documents 
were properly considered as evidence.' " (Id. at p. 620.)  
Because Appellants failed to object to the trial court's 
reliance on affidavits and failed to request an evidentiary 
hearing, they forfeited appellate review of those issues. (See 
Conservatorship of Farrant (2021) 67 Cal.App.5th 370, 377.) 
Despite the lack of merit in this appeal, the gravamen of 
Appellants' concern appears to be their frustration with the pace 
of the trial court's proceedings to determine the amount owed to 
the Prettyman Trust (and the accrual of additional costs during 
that process). But whatever the solution to adjudicating that 
issue expeditiously in the trial court, it is not before us in this 
appeal and provides us no ground to reverse an order that 
properly excluded a potential, as-yet undetermined liability.  
DISPOSITION 
 
The order is affirmed. The Public Guardian is entitled to 
costs on appeal. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.278(a)(4).)
