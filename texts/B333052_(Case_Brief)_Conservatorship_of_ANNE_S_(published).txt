**Case Name:** In re Anne S. (Conservatorship)

**Court and Date:** California Court of Appeal, [Date Not Specified]

**Procedural Posture:** Appeal from judgment on the pleadings dismissing Hankin's petition for conservatorship and awarding sanctions.

**Facts:**

* Marc B. Hankin, a neighbor of Anne S., filed a petition for appointment of a probate conservator for Anne.
* The Joint Petition was supported by declarations from Anne's family, friends, and medical personnel.
* Anne executed a Settlement Agreement with her stepson Jonathan S. and Barbara Lerer, which resolved the conservatorship disputes.
* Hankin opposed the Settlement Agreement, arguing Anne lacked capacity to sign legal documents.

**Legal Issue(s):**

* Whether Hankin has standing to bring a petition for conservatorship under Probate Code section 1820.
* Whether Hankin had standing as an "interested person" or "friend" to petition for Anne's conservatorship.

**Holding:** The court held that Hankin lacked standing to bring a petition for conservatorship under Probate Code section 1820 and that his arguments were legally frivolous, warranting the award of sanctions.

**Reasoning:**

* Hankin is not an "interested person" because he does not meet the statutory definitions of an heir, beneficiary, creditor, or other with a property right in or claim against the trust estate or decedent's estate.
* Hankin is not a "friend" because his only interaction with Anne was a single fleeting encounter, and Anne herself denied knowing Hankin or considering him a friend.
* Hankin does not qualify under any of the remaining categories of possible petitioners listed in section 1820.

**Conclusion:** The court affirmed the trial court's decision, concluding that Hankin lacked standing to petition for conservatorship of Anne under Probate Code section 1820 and that his arguments were legally frivolous.
