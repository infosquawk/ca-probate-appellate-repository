2 
In this will contest, siblings Anush Boyajian and Robert Boyajian 
assert competing documents regarding their deceased mother's testamentary 
intent—respectively, a will signed in 2006 and a document signed in 2018. 
The court ruled for Robert, concluding the 2018 document "canceled" the will, 
thus revoking it. (Prob. Code, § 6120, subd. (b) (section 6120(b).)2 
Anush contends the trial court erred because revocation by 
cancellation must occur by physical alteration of the will—not by a separate, 
stand-alone document. Robert disagrees but also asserts the revocation was 
valid pursuant to section 6120, subdivision (a) (section 6120(a)), because the 
2018 document qualified as a "subsequent will." 
In the published part of this opinion, we conclude California law 
(1) requires a physical alteration of a will to effect a revocation by 
cancellation, and (2) a stand-alone revocation does not constitute a 
subsequent will unless it also transfers property upon death. The court thus 
erred by giving effect to the 2018 document. 
Robert cross-appeals, claiming the record required the trial court 
to find Anush procured the 2006 will through undue influence. In the 
nonpublished part of this opinion, we find the court reasonably found there 
was no undue influence. Thus, we reverse and remand for the court to enter a 
new judgment giving effect to the 2006 will. 
 
 
2 All further undesignated statutory references are to the Probate 
Code and we will refer to individuals by their first names for clarity. Before 
the submission of this matter in this court, Anush passed away for purpose of 
appearing in this appeal and waiving oral argument. The trial court 
appointed Robert as the special administrator of Anush's estate. We granted 
a motion to substitute Robert for Anush as her personal representative. (Code 
Civ. Proc., § 377.31; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.36(a).)

FACTS 
The decedent, Layla Boyajian, was married to her ex-husband, 
Mike Boyajian, for 50 years. They had four children, including Robert, Anush, 
and two other daughters. Layla and Mike began divorce proceedings in 2004. 
Layla perceived Robert as taking her husband's side.  
In 2006, when she was 71 years old, Layla signed a two-page 
holographic will that bequeathed all of her estate to Anush, who lived with 
Layla at the time.
3 The will's authenticity and formalities are not disputed. 
Layla signed a second document in 2018. The document was 
prepared by Robert. Layla signed it before a notary public but it was not 
otherwise witnessed.  The 2018 document purported to revoke all of Layla's 
prior estate planning documents:  
 
3 With the exception of addresses, we quote the will verbatim, 
with the original spelling and grammar, omitting paragraph breaks: "After 
my death I'm Layla Boyajian Mother of Anush Boyajian. I leave every thing 
that I ow. my state [address] The Leonardo suit and Davinci Rest to my 
daughter Anush. The House [address]. All my Juree all my Furniture and 
gift's Carpts ext to my Anush Boyajian. She is the only one that I will leave. 
Layla Boyajian I must write Now this till I make the real Trust to my 
Daughter Anush Boyajian She will be Free after my Death To whom she will 
help her sister Rita Boyajian her sister R.J. Boyajian Nothing and Nothing to 
Robert Boyajian or Her Father Mike Boyajian I stamp this with my signature 
and my Thum. here Layla Boyajian March 3 - 2006 She is the only one I will 
leave my state To:"

After Layla's death in 2020, Anush petitioned to probate the 2006 
will, which she possessed since its creation. Robert contested the petition, 
claiming Layla had revoked the will by cancellation through the 2018 
document. The trial court conducted a bench trial that included dozens of 
exhibits and both expert and percipient witnesses, including the notary who 
witnessed Layla sign the 2018 document. 
Anush testified she found the will in 2006 while cleaning a room 
in Layla's house. She denied procuring the will in any way:  
"[Counsel:] . . . were you present when it was written by your 
mother?  
"[Anush:] No.  
"[Counsel:] Did you stand over your mother and tell her what to 
write on the 2006 will?  

 
5 
"[Anush:] No.  
"[Counsel:] Were you in the room when it was written?  
"[Anush:] No.  
"[Counsel:] Did you tell your mother to write out a will?  
"[Anush:] No.  
"[Counsel:] Did you suggest a language that appears in the 2006 
will?  
"[Anush:] No.  
"[Counsel:] Did you dictate to her from a different document what 
to write?  
"[Anush:] No.  
"[Counsel:] Were you even present when the will was written?  
"[Anush:] No.  
"[Counsel:] Did you in any way coerce your mother into writing 
this will?  
"[Anush:] No.  
"[Counsel:] Did you threaten your mother to get her to write this 
will?  
"[Anush:] No.  
"[Counsel:] Did you offer your mother any sort of inducement to 
write out this will?  
"[Anush:] No.  
"[Counsel:] Did you withhold anything from your mother like food 
to get her to write this will?  
"[Anush:] No.  
"[Counsel:] Did you cry and persuade her and ask her to write out 
a will in your favor?  

 
6 
"[Anush:] No.  
"[Counsel:] Did you have any knowledge this will was going to be 
written before it was written?  
"[Anush:] No.  
"[Counsel:] Until you found the will as you've described, did you 
have any knowledge that it had been written?  
"[Anush:] No.  
"[Counsel:] Did your mother tell you she had written this will 
before you found it?  
"[Anush:] No."  
In a detailed statement of decision, the court found Layla had 
died intestate because the 2018 document had validly revoked the 2006 will.  
The court found by clear and convincing evidence that the document 
expressed Layla's specific intent to revoke the will. The court reasoned that 
the document "constitute[d] a cancellation under . . . section 6120[(b)], even if 
no physical act was inflicted or applied directly on the will."   
The court rejected both Anush and Robert's arguments that the 
other had unduly influenced Layla to sign the 2006 will and 2018 document. 
For the will, the court concluded that, although the evidence showed "Anush 
indirectly (or maybe even directly) influenced Layla in writing the 2006 will[,] 
. . . the court finds that the combined evidence of probable and likely 
influence by Anush does not rise to the level of undue influence" necessary for 
Robert to prevail on the issue. 
DISCUSSION 
Section 6120 provides two grounds for revoking a will: "A will or 
any part thereof is revoked by any of the following: [¶] (a) A subsequent will 
which revokes the prior will or part expressly or by inconsistency. [¶] 

 
7 
(b) Being burned, torn, canceled, obliterated, or destroyed, with the intent 
and for the purpose of revoking it, by either (1) the testator or (2) another 
person in the testator's presence and by the testator's direction." 
We interpret the statute de novo, starting, "as always, with the 
text." (City of Los Angeles v. PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP (2024) 17 Cal.5th 
46, 64.) "'"If we find the statutory language ambiguous or subject to more 
than one interpretation, we may look to extrinsic aids, including legislative 
history or purpose to inform our views."' [Citation.] Ultimately, we must 
'"'select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent 
of the Legislature, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the 
general purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to 
absurd consequences.'"'" (Ibid.) 
I. 
REVOCATION BY CANCELLATION REQUIRES PHYSICAL ALTERATION 
The trial court held the 2018 document "canceled" the 2006 will 
pursuant to section 6120(b), finding Layla specifically intended the document 
to revoke the will. While revocation may well have been Layla's intention, the 
Probate Code requires more to effect a revocation by cancellation. 
The word "canceled" is reasonably susceptible to both broad and 
narrow interpretations. Broadly, "cancel" might mean to invalidate by any 
means. One might cancel a subscription online or by phone call. One might 
cancel a contract by giving separate written notice. 
But back in the Gilded Age, our high court gave "cancel" a 
narrow, hyper technical sense. It construed a predecessor statute of section 
6120 and explained that, "[i]n its primal significance," to cancel a will 
required a "lattice work" or "'criss-cross'" drawn on top of preexisting text. 
(Estate of Olmsted (1898) 122 Cal. 224, 230; id. at p. 229 [citing former Civil 

 
8 
Code § 1292].) While this 127-year-old case is still good law, even if we found 
"canceled" to be ambiguous, extrinsic aids confirm the Legislature intended it 
to be used in a narrow sense. 
Construing section 6120 invites analysis of the Uniform Probate 
Code. The statute is "the same in substance as Section 2-507 of the Uniform 
Probate Code (1987)." (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 53 West Ann. Code 
Prob. Code (2022 ed.) foll. § 6120, p. 197; accord § 2, subd. (b) [where Probate 
Code adopts Uniform Probate Code, it "shall be so construed as to effectuate 
the general purpose to make uniform the law . . . ."].) 
The official comments to Uniform Probate Code section 2-507 
note that revocation by act requires something be "done to the" will: 
"Revocation of a will may be by either a subsequent will or an authorized act 
done to the document." (8 West's U. Laws Ann. (2023) U. Prob. Code (2019), 
com. to § 2-507, p. 134.) 
Requiring an act "done to the" will is consistent with England's 
1677 Statute of Frauds, which allowed revocation by "a 'revocatory act'" such 
as "burning, canceling, tearing, or obliterating the will . . . ." (Horton, 
Revoking Wills (2022) 97 Notre Dame L.Rev. 563, 570 (Revoking Wills).) And 
it is consistent with section 6120(b), which allows revocation when a will is 
"burned, torn, canceled, obliterated, or destroyed . . . ."  As a statutory word 
"literally 'is known by its associates,'" the word "canceled" is still best 
construed to require a physical act akin to burning, tearing, obliterating, or 
destroying. (People v. Prunty (2015) 62 Cal.4th 59, 73.) 
Requiring a physical alteration to the will to find a revocation is 
an ancient concept, perhaps in need of revisiting. (See Revoking Wills, supra, 
97 Notre Dame L. Rev. at p. 570 [criticizing requirement].) But Robert 
presents no recent California authority expanding the concept of cancellation 

 
9 
beyond its historically narrow sense of a "lattice work" or "'criss-cross'" drawn 
over text. (Estate of Olmsted, supra, 122 Cal. at p. 230.)  As a stand-alone 
document, the 2018 revocation could not and did not cancel the 2006 will. 
II. 
THE 2018 DOCUMENT IS NOT A "SUBSEQUENT WILL" 
Robert alternatively contends we can affirm the judgment by 
deeming the 2018 document to be a "subsequent will" that revoked the 2006 
will pursuant to section 6120(a). Although Anush correctly notes that this 
theory was not presented to the trial court, we exercise our discretion to 
consider it because it parallels the litigated issue and raises a pure question 
of law based on undisputed facts. (Farrar v. Direct Commerce, Inc. (2017) 
9 Cal.App.5th 1257, 1275–1276, fn. 3.) 
Robert relies on the Probate Code's definition of "will," which at 
first blush might be parsed to include a stand-alone revocation. Section 88 
provides: "'Will' includes codicil and any testamentary instrument which 
merely appoints an executor or revokes or revises another will." There is no 
dispute the 2018 document merely revokes a will. 
Nonetheless, we find three hurdles to applying this definition of 
"will" to the 2018 document. 
First, the 2018 document is not a "testamentary instrument." The 
Probate Code defines "instrument" to require a beneficiary designation or 
property transfer: "'Instrument' means a will, a document establishing or 
modifying a trust, a deed, or any other writing that designates a beneficiary 
or makes a donative transfer of property." (§ 45.) And what makes a 
document "testamentary" is the revocable disposition of property upon death: 
"Before an instrument may be probated as a will it must appear from its 
terms . . . that it was executed with testamentary intent. The testator must 

 
10 
have intended, by the particular instrument offered for probate, to make a 
revocable disposition of his property to take effect upon his death." (Estate of 
Sargavak (1950) 35 Cal.2d 93, 95.)   
The 2018 document meets neither the Probate Code's definition 
of "instrument" nor the Supreme Court's conception of "testamentary intent." 
It names no beneficiary. It does not transfer or dispose of any property upon 
Layla's death.4 
Second, the 2018 document was not witnessed by two persons.  
The Probate Code requires that a "will shall be witnessed by being signed, 
during the testator's lifetime, by at least two persons . . . ."  (§ 6110, 
subd. (c)(1).) 
Robert tries to avoid the witness requirement by relying on 
Section 6110, subdivision (c)(2), which was added in 2008 (Stats. 2008, ch. 53, 
§ 1), presumably in response to the Supreme Court's recognition that 
California had not yet "adopted a 'harmless error' provision similar to 
Uniform Probate Code section 2-503." (Estate of Saueressig (2006) 38 Cal.4th 
1045, 1053.) To be sure, the 2008 amendment gives effect to an unwitnessed 
will "if the proponent of the will establishes by clear and convincing evidence 
that, at the time the testator signed the will, the testator intended the will to 
 
4 We are unpersuaded by Robert's citation to 
"thelawdictionary.org" and its dramatically broader definition of 
"testamentary instrument," which would include any "[d]ocument or will 
creating, extinguishing or transferring interest in or the right to an asset or 
property."   
 

 
11 
constitute the testator's will."5 (§ 6110, subd. (c)(2).) But critically, the 2008 
amendment stops short of adopting the full harmless error provision of the 
Uniform Probate Code. 
Omitted from section 6110, subdivision (c)(2) is the portion of the 
Uniform Probate Code that would give effect to the decedent's intent 
concerning "a partial or complete revocation of the will." (8 West's U. Laws 
Ann. (2023) U. Prob. Code (2019) § 2-503, subd. (2), p. 129.) We conclude the 
omission was intentional, reflecting the Legislature's judgment that witness 
formalities are still required to turn a stand-alone revocation into a will. 
Third, Robert cites no California case giving effect to a stand-
alone revocation that did not also make a donative transfer or revocable 
disposition upon death. Robert cites no California practice guide instructing 
practitioners to advise their clients they may revoke wills with stand-alone 
revocations. 
We readily acknowledge probate law trends towards flexibility.  
For example, "formalities should not be allowed to defeat the testator's intent 
when clear and convincing evidence satisfies the evidentiary concerns 
underlying the formalities of the statute of wills." (Estate of Duke (2015) 
61 Cal.4th 871, 893; id. at p. 879 [allowing extrinsic evidence to show 
reformation].) A respected wills and trusts professor laments that "revocation 
doctrine has never received sustained attention," yet "consists of tripwires 
and traps for the unwary." (Revoking Wills, supra, 97 Notre Dame L.Rev. at 
p. 563, italics omitted.) He notes the Uniform Probate Code's "harmless error 
 
5 As Robert did not pursue the "subsequent will" theory below, 
the trial court did not find whether Layla intended the 2018 document to 
"constitute [her] will." (§ 6110, subd. (c)(2).) The court instead found only that 
Layla "had the specific intent to revoke the 2006 will."  

 
12 
rule . . . spills over into the realm of revocation" (id. at p. 612) and criticizes 
the "handful of jurisdictions" with "'narrow' revocation legislation [that] limit 
written revocations to full-fledged 'will[s] which revoke[] the prior will'" (id. 
at p. 590; see also id. at p. 591 [citing cases disallowing stand-alone 
revocations, dubbed "anti-wills"]). 
California remains among this handful of states, having declined 
to enact the Uniform Probate Code's harmless error rule for "a partial or 
complete revocation of the will." (8 West's U. Laws Ann. (2023) U. Prob. Code 
(2019) § 2-503, subd. (2), p. 129.) The Legislature has set the limit to which it 
is willing to incorporate harmless error analysis into our revocation rules. 
Perhaps this too deserves revisiting. 
III. 
ROBERT HAS NOT SHOWN THE COURT WAS COMPELLED  
TO FIND UNDUE INFLUENCE 
Finally, Robert contends that even if we conclude no revocation 
was perfected, we should nonetheless affirm the trial court's invalidation of 
the 2006 will. (§ 6104.) Robert argues the court erred by ruling that he failed 
to show Anush unduly influenced Layla's creation of the 2006 will. (§ 8252, 
sub. (a).) 
At trial, Robert bore a "heavy burden" to prove undue influence 
by clear and convincing evidence. (Doolittle v. Exchange Bank (2015) 
241 Cal.App.4th 529, 545.) On appeal, "'"the question becomes whether 
the . . . evidence was (1) 'uncontradicted and unimpeached' and (2) 'of such a 
character and weight as to leave no room for a judicial determination that it 
was insufficient to support a finding.'"'" (Center for Healthcare Education & 
Research, Inc. v. International Congress for Joint Reconstruction, Inc. (2020) 
57 Cal.App.5th 1108, 1125 (Center for Healthcare Education.) 

 
13 
By statute, "'[u]ndue influence' means excessive persuasion that 
causes another person to act or refrain from acting by overcoming that 
person's free will and results in inequity." (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.70, 
subd. (a); § 86 [adopting Welf. & Inst. Code definition].) Factors include: 
"(1) The vulnerability of the victim," "(2) The influencer's apparent 
authority," "(3) The actions or tactics used by the influencer," and "(4) The 
equity of the result." (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 15610.70, subd. (a).) By common 
law, "[u]ndue influence is pressure brought to bear directly on the 
testamentary act, sufficient to overcome the testator's free will, amounting in 
effect to coercion destroying the testator's free agency." (Rice v. Clark (2002) 
28 Cal.4th 89, 96; David v. Hermann (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 672, 684–685 
[balancing factors]; accord, § 86 [statute supplements common law].)
6  
Robert fails to show his evidence of undue influence was not 
"'"'uncontradicted and unimpeached.'"'" (Center for Healthcare Education, 
supra, 57 Cal.App.5th at p. 1125.) Most notably, Anush flatly denied even 
knowing about the 2006 will until she found it: "[Counsel:] Did you have any 
knowledge this will was going to be written before it was written? [¶] 
[Anush:] No." She denied playing any role in obtaining it.  
In addition, evidence contradicted Robert's claim that Layla was 
vulnerable in 2006 due to the emotional distress caused by her divorce. The 
trial court found it "true that in 2006 Layla was emotionally distressed," but 
also concluded "Layla was not vulnerable . . . to the point where 
Anush . . . unduly influenced her in connection with the 2006 will." The court 
 
6 Robert does not argue any presumption applied. (Bernard v. 
Foley (2006) 39 Cal.4th 794, 800 [common law presumption]; Rice v. Clark, 
supra, 28 Cal.4th at pp. 96–97 [statutory presumption section 21380 
predecessor].) 

 
14 
also noted "very credible evidence indicating that around the time Layla 
wrote the 2006 will, she was able to appropriately participate in court, 
including multiple hours of depositions and meetings." "It is not our task to 
weigh conflicts and disputes in the evidence; that is the province of the trier 
of fact." (Howard v. Owens Corning (1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 621, 630.) 
Robert's evidence also left room for the trial court to find it 
insufficient. For example, even accepting his view about Anush's 
assertiveness, the court explicitly reasoned that even though "Layla's 
children influenced her and most likely persuaded her to act in certain 
ways . . . [¶] . . . the evidence [did] not support a finding that Anush unduly 
influenced Layla in 2006, or that Anush excessively persuaded Layla in 2006." 
(Italics added.) Distinguishing between degrees of influence is the trial 
court's duty—not all influence is undue. Influence "is not undue unless the 
pressure has reached a point where the mind of the person subjected to it 
gives way" and "represents in truth but the conviction or desire of another." 
(Estate of Anderson (1921) 185 Cal. 700, 707, italics added.) In other words, 
Robert has not demonstrated why the evidence compelled a result contrary to 
what the trier of fact determined. (Center for Healthcare Education, supra, 
57 Cal.App.5th at p. 1125.)  
Robert instead proposes five essential questions courts must 

 
15 
consider in deciding undue influence.7 Given that the statutory factors of 
"'[u]ndue influence'" and common law factors work together (§ 86), we take no 
issue with the notion that answers to some of the questions can help support 
a finding of undue influence. 
But answering these questions does not compel a conclusion of 
undue influence. Robert does not cite to any case where a trial court found 
against undue influence and an appellate court reversed that factual 
determination.  
Robert attempts to analogize to Estate of Garibaldi (1961) 
57 Cal.2d 108, where a trial court finding of undue influence was affirmed. 
(Id. at pp. 109–110, 114.) There, three children had unduly influenced their 
mother (the decedent testator) while partnering with her in ranch operations 
during a period when "[s]he was under the constant care of a physician." (Id. 
at pp. 109, 110, 111.) The children "engaged in a course of fraudulent conduct 
designed to conceal from decedent the large increase in her net worth." (Id. at 
pp. 113–114.)  
No similar facts are presented by Robert here. Robert has not 
shown Layla was under a physician's care, enfeebled, or confused. Robert has 
not shown Anush concealed material facts from Layla. There is no direct 
evidence of Anush pressuring Layla in any way. While Robert offers some 
 
7 "[(1)] Does the will cut off the natural objects of the decedent's 
bounty, and unduly benefit the proponent? [¶] [(2)] Is there a variance 
between the terms of the will and the expressed intentions of the testatrix? 
[¶] [(3)] Was there an opportunity afforded by the legatee's relationship to the 
decedent to influence the testatrix? [¶] [(4)] Was the decedent's mental and 
physical condition such as to permit a subversion of her freedom of will? [¶] 
[and (5)] Was the beneficiary active in procuring the execution of the will?" 
(Estate of Williams (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 302, 311; accord, Estate of Yale 
(1931) 214 Cal. 115, 123.) 

 
16 
evidence that may have tended to show undue influence,
8 he has not shown 
his evidence is "'"'of such a character and weight as to leave no room for a 
judicial determination that it was insufficient to support a finding.'"'" (Center 
for Healthcare Education, supra, 57 Cal.App.5th at p. 1125.) 
DISPOSITION 
The September 20, 2023 order for probate is reversed and the 
matter is remanded with directions for the trial court to (1) vacate the 
September 20, 2023 letters of administration, (2) admit the 2006 will to 
probate, and (3) conduct any further proceeding in a manner consistent with 
this opinion. Robert Boyajian, as the special administrator of Anush 
Boyajian's estate, is entitled to costs in this appeal.

8 Robert notes that Anush was not credible in explaining her 12-
year custody of the uniquely worded 2006 will. Robert also cites to the trial 
court's findings that at relevant times: Layla was emotionally distressed from 
her marriage ending; she wanted to ensure the financial security of all three 
of her daughters; she had lived with Anush, who was in a position to exert 
influence over Layla; and Anush could be very assertive with her parents.
