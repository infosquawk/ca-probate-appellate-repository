The Conservatorship Conundrum: A Cautionary Tale of Waiving Jury Trials in LPS Act Proceedings In a recent opinion, the court grappled with the delicate issue of ensuring the knowing and voluntary waiver of a jury trial in Lanterman-Petris-Short (LPS) Act conservatorship proceedings. At its core, the dispute centered around C.S., a proposed conservatee alleged to be gravely disabled due to mental illness, whose right to a jury trial was at stake. The journey began when the Tehama County Public Guardian filed a conservatorship petition on behalf of C.S. Following a bench trial, the court appointed a conservator over her person and estate, prompting an appeal to this court. The procedural history revealed a bench trial held on September 18, 2024, after which the court issued the order appointing the conservator. The legal issues at play revolved around whether the trial court's failure to personally advise C.S. of her right to a jury trial constituted reversible error. In this context, the court's application of Probate Code section 1828, subdivision (a)(6) and Welfare & Institutions Code section 5350 et seq. proved pivotal. The court's analysis turned on the totality of the circumstances approach, which requires an examination of whether C.S.'s waiver was knowing and voluntary. In this case, while counsel had informed her of her right to a jury trial, there was no evidence that she was personally present when this information was conveyed or that she expressed any disagreement with the waiver. The court ultimately held that the trial court's failure to personally advise C.S. of her right to a jury trial was prejudicial and requires reversal. This decision underscores the importance of ensuring that individuals subject to conservatorship proceedings are personally advised of their right to a jury trial, and that any waiver of that right is valid. Practitioners should take heed of this cautionary tale, recognizing the potential consequences of failing to provide such advisement, including the possibility of reversal on appeal. In LPS Act conservatorship proceedings, it is essential to ensure that proposed conservatees are properly advised of their right to a jury trial and that any waiver is knowing and voluntary. In conclusion, this opinion serves as a reminder of the critical role personal advisement plays in ensuring the knowing and voluntary waiver of a jury trial in LPS Act conservatorship proceedings. By applying Probate Code section 1828, subdivision (a)(6) and Welfare & Institutions Code section 5350 et seq., the court has provided valuable guidance for practitioners navigating these complex proceedings.
