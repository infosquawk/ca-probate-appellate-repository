A California Court Opinion: A Probate Practitioner's Guide In this article, we will delve into a recent California court opinion that highlights the importance of probate code provisions and their application in real-life scenarios. The case involves Dominic H., a minor child born to Brittany T. (biological mother) and Bernardino G. (alleged father), who seeks to establish his parental relationship with Dominic. The story begins when Ismael H., Marie's husband, takes Dominic from the hospital without informing Brittany of her paternity rights. Later, Brittany learns that she had given birth to a child whose parentage was not her own, and Ismael and Marie file a petition for legal guardianship in Los Angeles County. This sets off a chain reaction of events that ultimately leads to litigation. The procedural history of the case is complex, with multiple petitions filed by Ismael and Marie to terminate Brittany's parental rights under section 8604 (abandonment) and sections 7820 and 7822 to free Dominic from Brittany's custody and control. The trial court appoints counsel for Bernardino, Brittany, and Dominic, consolidates and stays proceedings on Bernardino's petition. The legal issues in dispute center around whether the trial court erred in denying Bernardino presumed father status under Adoption of Kelsey S. The court also considers whether the parties seeking termination of parental rights complied with the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) and related state law. Furthermore, the case explores whether Ismael and Marie's fraudulent conduct affected Bernardino's rights as a parent. In its analysis, the court applies Family Code sections 7664 (termination of parental rights) and 7822.1 (consent not necessary for adoption), as well as ICWA requirements. The court concludes that the trial evidence showed a lack of effort by Bernardino to establish his parentage or have contact with Dominic before April 2022. The court's reasoning is rooted in its interpretation of Kelsey S. and ICWA, emphasizing the need for biological fathers to demonstrate a prompt and full commitment to parental responsibilities. The court also applies California Probate Code sections 7664 and 7822 in determining whether Bernardino's consent was necessary for Dominic's adoption. In practical terms, this case highlights the importance of complying with ICWA requirements in termination of parental rights proceedings, particularly when dealing with cases involving Native American tribes or reservation children. Probate practitioners should be aware of the potential consequences of failing to comply with ICWA requirements, including conditional reversals and remands for full compliance. Ultimately, this opinion serves as a cautionary tale for biological fathers seeking to establish their parental relationships with minor children. It underscores the need for prompt and committed action to assume a parental role, lest one risk losing those rights altogether.
